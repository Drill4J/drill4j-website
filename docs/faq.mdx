**Does Drill work only with JVM?**
Currently yes, but we're working on .Net agent and JavaScript agent. Python and Ruby agents are also possible in the future.

**Which Java versions do you support?**
Java 8+

**Can I use Microservice applications?**
Yes, we're supporting microservice applications. See <a href='/docs/installation/microservices' target="_black">Microservices<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>

**Can I use Drill for Android applications?**
Yes, it is possible, but it's necessary to implement an agent for android application.

**Can I use .war?**
Yes, but only monolith applications on Tomcat, Jetty, WildFly. Java 8+

**What method of collecting coverage are you using?**
Probes in bytecode. So, methods can be covered in the range of 0.1 - 100.
Also, we will add the ability to choose a method of coverage collecting. (By string and etc.)

**Which test types do you support?**<br/>  <a href='docs/installation/extension' target="_black">- Manual<ExternalLinkIcon/></a><br/><a href='/docs/installation/autotest-agent' target="_black">- Auto (API, UI)<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>

**Why do I need it?**
Probably, if your project is small and doesn't have a lot of tests, then you don't need it. BUT, if it's a legacy project with a lot of tests, the tool saves your testing time via Test gap analysis and minimizing of regression suite.

**How can I specify a backend host for a frontend container?**
You need to set the **UPSTREAM** env variable for a frontend container.
By default, **UPSTREAM** value is **drill-admin:8090**

**Will information in the DB be saved, if I recreate backend container?**
Yes, but you need to move the **/work** directory to the volume

**Where can I find API requests?**
Swagger is available on port **8090** of backend service. For example, if  Drill frontend and backend parts are installed locally, then swagger is available at <a href='http://localhost:8090' target="_black">http://localhost:8090<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>

**My application has https connection. Does it suitable case for Drill?**
Yes, Drill supports https connection. See <a href='/docs/installation/drill-admin#https-setup' target="_black">HTTPS Setup<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>

**When is a method considered new or modified?** <br/>
You can find rules in the table:

| Result                         |   New   |   New   | Modified |   New   |   New   |   New   |   New   |
